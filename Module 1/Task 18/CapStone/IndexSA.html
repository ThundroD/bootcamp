                <h1>Life in SA: Mountains, Beaches, Deserts</h1><!--Adds intro paragraph-->
                <p>Sunny South Africa! There is much to love about SA and a lot to do. From game drives to amazing hikes, surfing to brais (cook outs for my fellow Americans), fishing to sampling great wines! There is so much to do here.
                </p>
                <p>I settled in Cape Town and it has become one of my favorite cities anywhere in the world. There are endless things to do outdoors. It only takes a short drive and you could be in a completely different geographic surrounding. There
                    are amazing wine estates just outside the city and some fablous restuarants for half the cost of what you'd be paying elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>South Africa is a bit unusal to write about, as it is the only country where I've bought a house, and also raised a family. Quiet different from when I used to travel solo or with my wife Nikky. That said, I'll also be touching on 
                    other aspects of SA, like raising a family.</p>

                <h2>What Makes SA Great</h2><!--Adds text-->
                <p>There are a lot of reasons why SA is a great country but I'm going to have to only mention a few of the highlights here.</p>
                <h3>Cost of Living</h3>
                <p>Comparatively SA has a very low cost of living. If you make dollars or pounds there is so much to do and things you can afford that you couldn't back home. For example, having a house cleaner or a nanny for your kids.</p>
                <h3>Natural Beauty</h3>
                <p>Like I stated before, South Africa's landscape is amazing. There is so much to do since different typographies are so close. This naturally leads to a healthy lifestyle since you end up spending a lot of time outdoors. Also there are so many unique 
                    animals, going for a game drive and seeing all of the wild animals blows your mind away epecially if you grew up just seeing these animals in zoos.
                </p>
                <h3>Wine and Brais</h3>
                <p>South Africa has some of the best wine in the world, and living in Cape Town you are 30 mins or so to all of these amazing farms. Going out for a weekend to a hotel or wine farm is an escape into luxery. Other great things to do on the weekend is the Brai (remember Americans it's a cook out). Brais are 
                    serious business in SA and going over to a friends house for some drinks and a brai is a regualar activity. Also you don't just cook one animal, on of the first things you'll notice is that you cook pretty much the entire farm and probably a game animal like Springbok or two on the brai as well. 
                </p>

                <h2>Some of the Downsides to SA</h2><!--Adds text-->
                <p> Although there is much to love about South Africa, every country has it's flaws.</p>
                <h3>Inequality</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest set backs to South Africa is that it is a poorer country, this means higher inequality and fewer jobs. The inequality is stark. Yes there is inequality everywhere but it's noticiable the second you land.
                    There also aren't many job opportunities, I started my own company as soon as I got here, so I was lucky it took off. However, for most and especially that might be coming to stay of a year or two there aren't many jobs avaiable.
                    Most jobs that are available are low paying. 
                </p>
                <h3>Crime</h3>
                <p>Inequality and lower paying jobs leads to higher crime. Another first thing that you notice about South Africa, is that all the houses have walls and some even have electrial fencing. I for one was pretty shocked by this aesthetical choice
                    but soon realized how practical it is. Someone has attempted to kidnap my son, while with his Nanny and my friends also had the same happen to them. Luckily the kinnappers were unsuccessful. However, there is reason to be cautious in SA.</p>
                <h3>It's far</h3>
                <p>Now this is a personal one. SA is far from the US, it's far from a lot of places. This makes cost of flights expensive. Also a 20 hour flight with two kids is exhausting</p>

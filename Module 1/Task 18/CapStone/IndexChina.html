                <h1>Life in China: People Mountain, People Sea</h1><!--Adds intro paragraph-->
                <p>China is a world to it's own. No wonder they call it the Middle Kingdom. It's massive, not only in terms of population but the feel of the place. I can only compare perspective of living in China to the US, where when you live there you feel it is the only country in the world and everything that is happening is only happening there, everything else doesn't really matter too much.</p>
                <p>I lived in Xuzhou, a "smaller city" of 10 million people from 2015-2016. Buildings were going up everywhere, the metro was being built and smog blanketed the city. It felt as if I'd been transported to the industrial revolution circa 2000.</p>
                <p>I also traveled a lot around China seeing major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Much more developed and a lot of fun, in terms of entertainment, but also enjoyed my experience living in a place where things were "just starting to happen.</p>

                <h2>Some Great Things About China</h2><!--Adds intro paragraph-->
                <p>For a place that is as big as China there are probably a lot more on the list but here are a few.</p>
                <h3>The History</h3>
                <p>If you're a history buff as much as I am, China has tons of things to see. Unfortunately a lot of older buildings have been bulldozed to make way for new highrises but there is still tons to see. Just speak with the people and you'll hear tons of oral history about different places, which would be hard to find via Google.</p>
                <h3>Cusine</h3>
                <p>If you think General Tso's is Chinese food think again, it isn't. Chinese takeout is not Chinese food. Each province is known for it's types of dishes, similar to the US. I fell in love with the way the Chinese eat, and they LOVE to eat. Sitting down with friends and ordering tons of food for hours on end. I did this every weekend. </p>
                <h3>Connection "Guangxi"</h3>
                <p>"Guangxi", roughly translated means connection. People in China establish great relationships. I made some great friends there. The stronger your connection with someone the more likely they help you out. So Chinese people are always very open and friendly. They're quick to invite you to dinner and take real interest in who you are.</p>

                <h2>Some of the Drawbacks to China</h2>
                <p> China is developing and although there are many good things about China there are things to improve upon.</p>
                <h3>Pollution</h3>
                <p>There were days that I'd look outside my apartment window and I couldn't see the ground. It was that polluted. I'd walk across the street and couldn't see cars coming. It was that polluted.</p>
                <h3>Hygiene</h3>
                <p>Food safety isn't a big priority in China. As much as I like the cusine and eating culture, there were many restuarants that were dirty. Markets a with live animals, dead animals and flies were common place. Restuarant toilets are open and usually unclean. Cigarette buds are everywhere and smoking inside is still commonplace.</p>
                <h3>Big Brother</h3>
                <p>The Chinese government is restrictive...and that is putting it lightly. Everything is tracked. From purchases, traffic lights, and even private conversations. You have to be careful about what you say and who you say it to. Western social media is restricted and a "certain form" of history is being told. Speak to most Chinese about news topics and you'll get a recorded message straight from the CCP.</p>

/* the string template literal allows for you to create a multilined string
while adding the variables in place. In my first submission I struggled to find the 
` which I explained in my fortune task as well. I did my first submission in a long drawn
out way and didn't go back after realizing where the backtick was. I still don't know where it
is on my Macbook pros keyboard and keep having to copy and past. I've tried looking it up online 
with no luck. If you could please let me know in the your next grading commennts that would be appreciated.
I completely understand my last submission was very messy and ineffective for an easy outcome like this
I hope that this submission shows that I can now explain my work.*/

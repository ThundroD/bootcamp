        <p>I'm a really good swimmer. I started swimming when I was only 8 months old. Now that I'm older I can swim faster and don't
            need dad to help me. </p>
        <p>One of the best parts about swimming is jumping into the swimming pool. My favorite jump is a cannon ball.
            Can you do a cannon ball?</p><!--Swimming Paragraphs-->

        <p>My brother's name is Jackson. He is 1 years old.<br><br> Although I still think he is a baby I like playing with him. 
            We like to play with pokemon and dinosaurs. We watch TV like <em>"PeppaPig"</em> and <em>"Hey Dougie"</em> together.</p>
        <p>Oh we also like to make forts on the couch and play hide and go seek. I'm much better at hiding than Jackson is.</p><!--Playing with brother paragraphs. Added a break to show how it could be used-->
